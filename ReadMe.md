# 🧠 JavaScript Learning Vault

Welcome to my JavaScript learning vault — a personal collection of interactive projects, mini-apps, and hands-on experiments created to master modern JavaScript fundamentals through real-world coding.

This repository serves as:
- A self-paced project log 📒
- A sandbox for trying out new JS concepts 🧪
- A progressive learning portfolio 🚀

---

## 📌 What's Inside

Each folder contains a small project or concept, complete with:
- Clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Commented code to explain logic
- Visual output (UI-first focus)
- Optionally: localStorage, API use, or event-based interactions

---

## 🚀 Goals of This Repo

- Move beyond JavaScript theory through practical coding
- Build a strong grasp of DOM, Events, Arrays, Functions, and APIs
- Apply version control with Git and host using GitHub Pages
- Track and reflect on daily/weekly progress
- Build a habit of writing clean, readable, modular JS

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- HTML5 & CSS3 (for UI)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Git + GitHub (version control & hosting)
- GitHub Pages (for live previews)

## Learning Approach

This repository is designed for hands-on learning through **project-based development**. You won't find lengthy tutorials here – just the opportunity to learn by doing. Everything is built from scratch using **raw JavaScript**, without the use of any frameworks.
